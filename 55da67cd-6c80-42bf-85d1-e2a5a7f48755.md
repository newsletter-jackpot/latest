Understanding the Human Skeleton

The structure of the human body is remarkably complex, serving as a framework for movement and protection. The adult human skeleton comprises 206 connected bones. The largest bone in the body is the thigh bone (femur), and the smallest is the stapes (stirrup) in the middle ear. This intricate system not only supports our physical form but also plays a vital role in the production of blood cells.
