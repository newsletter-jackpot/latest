Understanding the Human Skeleton

The human body is a complex structure that provides support and facilitates movement. The adult human skeleton comprises 206 connected bones. The largest bone in the body is the thigh bone (femur), and the smallest is the stapes (pronounced ‘staypiz’), in the middle ear. This intricate framework plays a crucial role in protecting vital organs and enabling mobility.
